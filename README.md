# The Intelligence Engine

**How Customer Support Becomes Your Company's Strategic Advantage**

*by Igor Quoos Moreira*

## About This Book

Most companies treat customer support as a necessary cost center‚Äîa place to handle complaints and close tickets as quickly as possible. This thinking creates a death spiral where support costs scale with business growth while providing diminishing strategic value.

**The Intelligence Engine** reveals a different approach: transforming support from a reactive cost center into a proactive intelligence system that prevents problems, identifies opportunities, and develops talent.
